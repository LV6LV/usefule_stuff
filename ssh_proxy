#First setup ssh dynamic fwding.
ssh user@ip -D1080

# Edit the SSH configuration file using a text editor of your choice:
nano ~/.ssh/config

# Add the following lines to the file:
Host remote-host
  ProxyCommand socat - SOCKS4A:localhost:%h:%p,socksport=1080

# In this example, replace remote-host with the hostname or IP address of the remote host you want to connect to via SSH.

# Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

# Connect to the remote host via SSH:
ssh remote-host

# This should establish an SSH connection to the remote host via the SOCKS proxy server running on localhost:1080.

# Note that using a proxy server may introduce additional latency and security risks, so always make sure to follow best practices for network security and use trusted proxy servers.
